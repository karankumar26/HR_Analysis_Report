# HR Analytics

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of my HR Analytics project was to delve into employee attrition trends within an organization. By leveraging data, I aimed to uncover patterns and factors that contribute to attrition rates. This project had a twofold objective: to provide insights into existing attrition and to help management take proactive measures to reduce attrition rates.

## Visualizing Data with Tableau
Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, played a pivotal role in bringing my project to life. I harnessed its capabilities to create a range of compelling visuals that provide a comprehensive understanding of HR-related data.

 ## Report Snapshot



## Vizualization
#### 1. Department-wise Attrition
One of the key insights presented in the dashboard is department-wise attrition. This pie chart visually depicts attrition rates across different departments within the organization, offering a quick overview of where attrition is most prominent.
#### 2. Attrition by Education
This bar chart highlights how education levels correlate with attrition rates. It provides HR and management teams with insights into whether certain education backgrounds are more likely to leave the organization.
#### 3. Age Group Analysis
Age often plays a role in attrition. This bar chart breaks down the employee population into age groups, enabling HR to identify trends and make age-specific HR strategies.
#### 4. Gender-based Attrition
This donut chart presents attrition rates based on gender, allowing for a gender-centric analysis of attrition within the organization.
#### 5. Job Satisfaction Heat Map
Job satisfaction is a crucial factor in attrition. The heat map visually represents job satisfaction ratings across different departments, enabling the identification of areas that need improvement.
#### 6. Attrition by Gender
The polar chart provides a unique perspective on attrition, showing how gender influences attrition across various job roles.
#### 7. Key Metrics
These five cards present key HR metrics briefly, including employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employees, and average age. These metrics are vital for HR and management decision-making.


## Conclusion
Incorporating this Tableau dashboard into my portfolio has not only showcased my data visualization skills but also highlighted the critical insights that data analysis can offer to HR departments. By exploring department-wise attrition, education-based trends, age group analysis, gender-based attrition, job satisfaction, and other key metrics, this project has demonstrated the potential for data-driven HR decisions.
